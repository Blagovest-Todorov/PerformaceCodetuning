            // the performance is not only time to execute a given tasks, given commands.,  Good performance can means 
            // less requests to the dataBase!  so less usage of the Ram Memory of the side the  DataBase/ Less usage of the Computer resources, 
            // Less usage of the  Battery, good Performance may mean, on Bigger load the system to  continue work normally, //
            // To have big vaule of Data and w eto be able go work. . Short data transmission time .
            ///Balance is looked between ->performace--Quality of the code ! Not always the performance is dependantof the code quality.

            // what affects teh performance:  External devioces- > Storage, network, Internet connection , Operation System.]
            // Code Tuning- means to write teh code or the part of teh code to be rewritten again to better the perforam nice.
